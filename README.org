* Barriers to infection
  - skin/mucous membranes
  - innate immune system
  - adaptive immune system

* Immune systems
** Innate 
   - fast-acting system
   - non-specific reaction
     - same cells, same reaction to many invaders
   - no memory
     - 2^nd infection same response as 1^st infection
** Adaptive 
   - slow-acting (days)
   - highly specific
     - unique cells activated to respond to a single invader
   - memory
     - 2^nd infection: faster response

* Antigen presentation
  - innate system can be activated by "free" antigen
    - pathogenic molecules detected freely in blood, tissue
  - adaptive system requires "antigen presentation"
    - pathogens must be engulfed by cells, broken down
    - pieces of protein transported to surface
    - antigen "presented" to T cells for activation

* Cytokines 
  - cell signaling proteins
  - often released by immune cells
  - stimulates inflammatory response
  - various subsets
    - chemokines: attract immune cells (chemotaxis)
    - interleukins: IL-1, IL-2, etc.
    - tumor necrosis factor (TNF): can cause tumor cell death
    - transforming growth factor (TGF)
    - interferons: named for interfering w/ viral replication

* Cluster of differentiation (CD) 
  - cellular surface molecules
    - CD3, CD4, CD8
  - found on many immune cells (T cells, B cells)
  - used to identify cell types
  - some used as receptor/cell binding

* Innate immune system
  - phagocytes
    - [[Macrophages][macrophages]] (hallmark cell)
    - [[Neutrophil][neutrophils]]
  - complement
  - natural killer cells
  - eosinophils
  - mast cells and basophils 

* Innate immunity
** General principles
   - recognize molecules that are "foreign"
   - "pathogen-associated molecular patterns" (PAMPs)
     - present on many microbes
     - not present on human cells
   - pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
   - key receptor class: "Toll-like receptors" (TLRs)
     - macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells
     - recognize PAMPs /rarr secrete cytokines

** Pattern recognition
   - endotoxin (LPS)
     - LPS binds LPS-binding protein (found in plasma)
     - binds *CD14 on macrophages*
     - triggers TLR4
     - cytokine production: IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF
   - peptidoglycan cell wall
     - NOD receptors (intracellular)
     - nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
     - cytokine expression
   - mannose (polysaccharide on bacteria/yeast)
     - mannose-binding lectin (MBL) from liver
     - activated lectin pathway of complement activation
   - lipteichoic acid on Gram-positive bacteria
   - double stranded RNA
   - unmethylated DNA

** Monocytes and macrophages
   - [[Macrophages][macrophages]]: guardians of innate immunity
   - produced in bone marrow as monocytes
   - circulate in blood ~3 days
   - enter tissues /rarr macrophages
     - Kupffer cells (liver)
     - micrglia (CNS)
     - osteoclasts (bone)
   - three key functions 
     - [[Phagocytosis][phagocytosis]]
     - cytokine production
     - anitgen presentation

*** Phagocytosis
    - macrophages engulf pathogens into phagosome
    - phagosome merges w/ lysosome
    - lysosomes contain deadly enzymes
    - death of bacteria, viruses
    - reactive oxygen species (superoxides)
      - produced by NADPH oxidase (respiratory burst)
      - generate hydrogen peroxide H_{2}O_2 and O_{2}^/minus
    - reactive nitrogen intermediates
      - NO (nitric oxide) + O_{2}^/minus (superoxide) /rarr ONOO^/minus (peroxynitrite)
    - enzymes:
      - proteases
      - nucleases
      - lysozymes (hydrolyze peptidoglycans)
    - lysosome enzyme secretion
      - lung abscess
    - some pathogens block this process
      - tuberculosis modifies phagosome
      - unable to fuse w/ lysosme
      - proliferation inside macrophages
      - protection from antibodies
    - Chediak-Higashi syndrome
      - immune deficiency syndrome
      - failure of lysosomes to fuse w/ phagosomes
      - recurrent bacterial infections

*** Macrophages
    - macrophages can exist in several "states"
    - resting: debris removal
    - activated ("primed"): more effective
    - more activators (via surface TLRs):
      - LPS from bacteria
      - peptidoglycan
      - bacterial DNA (no methylation)
    - also, *IFN-/gamma* from T cells, NK cells
    - attracted by C5a (complement)
   
**** Key surface receptors

     | Surface molecule   | Signal |
     |--------------------+--------|
     | CD14               |        |
     | F_c receptor       |        |
     | C3b receptor       |        |
     | _T cell molecules_ |        |
     |  MHC               | CD4    |
     |  B7                | CD28   |
     |  CD40              | CD40L  |

**** Cytokines
     - key cytokines are [[IL-1 and TNA-/alpha][IL-1 and TNA-/alpha]]
     - others: [[IL-6, IL-8, IL-12][IL-6, IL-8, IL-12]]

***** IL-1 and TNA-/alpha
      - both /uarr synthesis of endothelial adhesion molecules 
	- allow neutrophils to enter inflamed tissue
      - IL-1 
	- "endogenous pyrogen" (causes fever)
	- acts on hypothalamus
      - TNF-/alpha
	- can cause vascular leak, septic shock
	- "Cachectin:" inhibits lipoprotein lipase in fat tissue
	- reduces utilization of fatty acids /rarr cachexia
	- kills tumors in animals ("tumor necrosis factor")
	- can cause intravascular coagulation /rarr DIC
***** IL-6, IL-8, IL-12
      - IL-6
	- fever
	- stimulates acute phase protein production in liver (CRP)
      - IL-8 
	- attracts neutrophils
      - IL-12
	- promotes Th1 development (cell-mediated response)
** Neutrophil
   - derived from bone marrow
   - granules stain pink w/ Wrightstain
     - Eosinophils=red, Basophils=blue
   - circulate ~5 days and die unless activated
   - drawn from blood stream to sites of inflammation
   - enter tissues: phagocytosis
     - granules are lysosomes (Bactericidal enzymes)
   - provide extra support to macrophages
*** Blood stream exit
    - rolling
      - selectin ligand (SLIG) neutrophils (Sialyl-Lewis X)
      - binds E-selectin or P-selectin endothelial cells 
    - crawling (tight binding)
